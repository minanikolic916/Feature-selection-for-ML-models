# Feature Engineering Project 🛠️📊

Welcome to the Feature Engineering Project that is dedicated to exploring and implementing advanced feature engineering techniques to improve Machine Learning model performance. 

## 🌟 Project Overview 

The focus of the project is to give a broader understanding of how different feature engineering techiques reduce the computational resources and noise present in the data. 

### 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas and Numpy for data loading and manipulation
- Imblearn for dealing with imbalanced data
- Scikit-learn for modeling, metrics, preprocessing
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- LIME, SHAP and Eli5 for XAI
- Sklearn-genetics for implementing feature selection via genetic algorithms

### 📁 Repository Structure

The repository structure consists of the core implementation in a form of a Jupyter Notebook as well as a theoretical paper focusing on research methodologies.
